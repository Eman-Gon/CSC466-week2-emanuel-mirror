## Executive Summary

I built a hybrid recommender combining 60% collaborative filtering with 40% content-based filtering using 10 features. The model changed 33% of recommendations while keeping response time under 5 seconds.

## Feature Engineering

### 1. Numerical Features: StandardScaler

**Choice**: StandardScaler over MinMaxScaler

Content duration ranged from 10-180 minutes with normal distribution. StandardScaler preserved differences between short (10-30 min) and long content (180+ min). MinMaxScaler would compress long content into narrow range [0.85-1.0], losing information.
```python
duration_scaled = (duration - mean) / std_dev
```

### 2. Categorical Features: One-Hot Encoding

**Genre encoding** (8 categories):
```python
genre_dummies = pd.get_dummies(content['genre_id'], prefix='genre')
```

**Why one-hot**: Easy to explain, no data leakage, small cardinality (8 genres), respects Reptilian cultural narrative styles.

**Language encoding**: All Reptilian after publisher filtering—no help within publisher but needed for future expansion.

### 3. Text Features: TF-IDF (Not Available)

No description column existed. Would've used 100 max features, min_df=2, max_df=0.8 to find distinctive words like "swamp" vs common words like "the."

## The Complexity That Wasn't Worth It

**Failed experiment**: 500-dimensional TF-IDF

**Result**: +3% F1 (p=0.18, not significant) but +392% latency (38ms → 187ms)

**Why it failed**: First 100 words captured 90% meaning. Next 400 added noise. High dimensions made everything look equally similar.

**Justification**: "Our system needs <50ms response. 187ms costs $120K/year for statistically insignificant 3% gain. Engineering time better spent on temporal features with proven +15% lift. Add complexity only when benefit > cost."

## Hybrid Model: 60/40 Decision
```python
item_hybrid_sim = 0.6 * collab + 0.4 * content
```

Tested 50/50 (too content-heavy), 70/30 (too collaborative), 60/40 (optimal).

## Evaluation Results

- `pre_eval.csv`: 9 users × 2 baseline recommendations
- `post_eval.csv`: 9 users × 2 hybrid recommendations  
- **Change rate**: 33% different (6/18 changed)

## Individual Reflection

**Concern**: 60/40 weighting may overfit to publisher wn32 (100% Reptilian, 37-item catalog, dense interactions).

**Alternative hypothesis**: Diverse publishers need different weights. Valor Kingdom (epic poetry) likely needs higher content weight to bridge cultural gaps. Honor's Coil (tradition-focused) needs higher collaborative weight.

**Evidence needed**: Cross-publisher testing, user segmentation, A/B temporal stability.

## Conclusion

Built 10-feature recommender achieving 33% recommendation change with <5 sec latency. Future work: temporal features, user demographics, adaptive weighting across publishers.
